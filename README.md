# ALX Project Nexus ‚Äì ProDev Frontend Engineering

## Overview

**Project Nexus** is a comprehensive documentation hub showcasing major learnings and milestones from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering** program. This repository consolidates key frontend technologies, tools, real-world challenges, solutions, and best practices experienced throughout the program.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Serve as a reference guide for current and future learners.
- Promote collaboration with backend learners.
- Demonstrate a deep understanding of frontend engineering principles.

## üíª Program Overview

The **ProDev Frontend Engineering** program focused on building production-ready frontend applications using modern technologies. It involved hands-on work, collaboration with backend teams, and real-world project scenarios.

---

## üöÄ Key Technologies and Concepts

### 1. **Web & Mobile Development**
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, routing, and API integration.
- **React Native & Expo**: Mobile-first development with native components.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**: Offline support, installable experiences.

### 2. **Styling and UI**
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS for fast and consistent design.
- **Material UI / ShadCN**: Ready-made components with customisation.

### 3. **Programming Languages**
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for safer, scalable JavaScript.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Functional programming and modern syntax.

### 4. **API Integration**
- **GraphQL**: Query-based data fetching, Apollo Client usage.
- **REST APIs**: Standard HTTP communication with backend services.

### 5. **State Management**
- **Redux Toolkit**: Efficient global state handling.
- **React Context**: Light-weight state sharing.

### 6. **System Design**
- Component modularity and scalability.
- Directory and architecture best practices.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Expo EAS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Adapting GraphQL to a dynamic frontend | Used codegen for typing and caching |
 API errors and data shaping | Wrote reusable Apollo error handlers and DTO mappers |
| Styling consistency across platforms | Adopted design tokens and Tailwind breakpoints |

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Takeaways

- **Code Reusability**: Built shared components and hooks.
- **Collaboration**: Paired with backend learners to align contracts.
- **Testing**: Used Jest, Playwright, and Cypress for confidence.
- **Accessibility**: Added keyboard support and ARIA attributes.
- **Documentation**: Wrote JSDoc and integrated Storybook for UI docs.

---

## ü§ù Collaboration

We worked closely with backend learners from the ProDev Backend track. Shared GraphQL schemas, aligned API expectations, and tested integrations early.
